        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a member of the Softcoin community, you’re invited to join the Softie Program, a unique opportunity that allows you to become a shareholder in our dynamic cryptocurrency project. Unlike traditional crypto airdrop initiatives, our Softie Program offers you the chance to earn more and engage deeply with the growth of Softcoin. Here’s why becoming a Softie is an investment decision you won’t want to miss.</p>

        <h2>Investment Structure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commitment Levels:</strong> As a Softie, you can choose from various investment levels, each tailored to meet different financial goals. Whether you’re starting with a modest $5 or committing up to $5000 or more, there’s a commitment level for you. Each tier is crafted to provide maximum returns, enhancing your investment potential.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Returns:</strong> Your investment as a Softie will earn daily returns that surpass those of conventional crypto airdrop projects. Depending on your commitment level, you could enjoy returns ranging from 3% to 8% daily. This means your investment grows steadily, offering a more substantial income stream.</li>
            <li><strong>Commitment and Returns:</strong> Our platform allows you to start earning returns with as little as $5. By increasing your commitment level, you can boost your returns and maximize your earnings. Your daily profits continue until the Token Generation Event (TGE), ensuring a reliable income flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Withdrawals:</strong> Enjoy the freedom to withdraw your earnings at any time. With a minimum withdrawal limit of $10 and no upper limit, you have complete control over your funds. This flexibility is designed to cater to your financial needs and preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Referral and Sharing Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Referral Rewards:</strong> As a Softie, you have the opportunity to earn additional rewards by referring others to the Softcoin project. When someone you’ve referred makes a commitment, you receive 5% of their commitment amount. This incentivizes you to expand your network and reap the rewards of your referrals.</li>
            <li><strong>Building a Tribe:</strong> By referring friends, you can build your own tribe within the Softcoin community. This not only increases your earning potential but also contributes to the overall success and growth of the project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Commitment Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commitment Tiers:</strong> Each tier is clearly defined, allowing you to choose an investment level that matches your financial goals. From entry-level investments to higher stakes, our commitment levels are designed to provide significant returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Earnings Potential:</strong> We provide transparent information about potential earnings at each commitment level. This clarity helps you make informed decisions and understand the financial benefits of your investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlocking and Refunds:</strong> Your commitment is locked in until the Token Generation Event (TGE), after which it will be fully refunded. This ensures a clear timeline for your investment and guarantees that your funds are returned.</li>
        </ul>
